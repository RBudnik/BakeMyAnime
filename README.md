### Functions
* convert 10-bit titles into 8-bit;
* repack mkv files with subtitles and audio of your choice.

### Why?
I got tired of converting and repacking every episode of every title that I wanted to view on smartphone (needed 8-bit, packed audio) or PC (play file by file without skipping audio files in player).

## To Do list:
* *Fix*: rework debug process;
* *Add*: store default anime folder to make choosing faster;
* *Add*: recognize bit depth of video;
* *Add*: "About" window.
